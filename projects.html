    <strong id="DI"> Destination Imagination: </strong>
    Destination Imagination (DI) is something that I did for 2 consecutive years, with some friends.  In this program our creative, and logical skills were put to the test, and we had to go through many competitions.  This was a program I enjoyed very much!

    <strong id="EMA"> EMA Leadership: </strong>
    In this program, I was given the chance to assist in many martial arts classes in the dojo I went to.  Every month we attended at training, which taught us the key principles of teaching martial arts.  We would be tested after a certain amount of classes assisted in, to progress to the next level of becoming a assistant.  Then eventually we would become an instructor!

    <strong id="WeCan"> WeCanToo: </strong>
    WeCanToo is a coding program, that teaches girls coding.  I am apart of this program, and I am learning how to code with the help of highschoolers.  This program is very informative, and exciting.  The knwoledge of coding will help me in the future, and I am grateful that I am apart of this program!
    <br> </br>
    <strong id="SPCA"> Volunteering: </strong>
    In 2019 I volunteered at an animal shelter, known as East Bay SPCA.  There were two reasons for this. The first one was because I love animals, and the second was I wanted to have exposure on how to take care of dogs. I loved this program so much, that my family and I ended up adopting a dog a few months later!
